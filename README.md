# HEALTH STATUS DETECTION USING RASPBERRY PI AND AI

# Project Description

Innovative healthcare solutions are characterized as being non-invasive, affordable, having reduced response time, and easing the burden on caregivers for the elderly and individuals requiring continual care. This innovative project provides real-time monitoring and action state feedback on the state of medical patients. 

# General Overview
- From Dataset to Mediapipe to LSTM to Action State

# Model System Design
- The problem
- Choosing the model. Why LSTM?
- Getting the Data
- Exploratory Data Analysis (Getting the video, No of Frames, No of Counts ...)
- Choosing Tensorflow vs Pytorch
- Training the model (Results)
- Describe how someone can use the code
- Post a snippet of it working
- Recommendations to improve the project or the model

# Hardware
- How the hardware works in general (Control System, align the camera frame with that of the image)

# Backend Description
- Why the need for a backend system?
- Describe the system design you used.
- Describe the tools you used
- Describe how someone can execute the code if they wish
- Post a snippet of it working
- Post recommendations for someone who wants to take it further
